**Pattern Day Trading (PDT)** is a regulatory classification in the United States that applies to traders who execute **four or more day trades within five business days** **in a margin account**, provided that the number of day trades is more than **6% of the total trades** in that account during the same period.

### üîç **Key Points about PDT:**

- **Day trade** = Buying and selling (or shorting and covering) the same stock on the **same trading day**.
- Applies **only to margin accounts**, not cash accounts.
- If classified as a Pattern Day Trader, you must maintain a **minimum account equity of $25,000** at all times.
- If your account falls below $25,000, your broker will restrict your ability to day trade until the minimum is restored.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why it matters:**

This rule is enforced by **FINRA** and is designed to protect inexperienced traders from the risks of excessive short-term trading using leverage. Violating PDT rules without maintaining the required balance can result in your account being **restricted or frozen** for 90 days or until the account is funded appropriately.
